# Outreach Spectrogram
A very basic spectrogram that, in theory, has room to grow and improve.
In fact it has a very large amount of room. Any questions or issues please
email Thomas Wallace at t.wallace.1@research.gla.ac.uk.

This README will be a very basic guide into the usage and todo list of the repo
as well as some basic troubleshooting.
